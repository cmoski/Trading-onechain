These are just random notes. Could be about anything.

###OneChain contract talking points

Vesting schedule—upon being acquired (want to be fully vested in case of acquisition)
Errors and Omission insurance (professional liability coverage)—not covered in current OneChain contracts
(possibly a separate policies that cover data breach, etc.)
cyber and privacy coverage (privacy liability, privacy breach)
copyright infringement (coverage for that as well)
make sure OneChain has coverage for data breach, etc. (also data theft, theft of Trezor wallet, ...)
