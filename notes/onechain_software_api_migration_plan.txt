Migration plan for OneChain software API testing:

1) Hat continues to test using his own accounts
1a) May be able to get Alvin set up with OneChain software and show him how to generate API keys to test the software with his accounts
2) OneChain deposits SMALL amount on various exchanges and Hat tests with these
3) I walk through OneChain through the process of creating new API keys for their exchange accounts, and Cliff/Will test OneChain software with these


I basically want to move through this list ONLY when absolutely necessary. So until I hit the limit of testing I can do with my own accounts (or feel the testing has been exhausted at this level), I will continue with step #1.

I'll talk to you guys when we need to move to the next step(s).

All good in the hood!
